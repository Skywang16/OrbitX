NOTE: The user is NOT currently in any workspace directory.

File system tools (read_file, write_file, list_files, shell, etc.) are NOT available.

You can only have a general conversation. If the user asks about files or wants to run commands, inform them that they need to open a terminal tab first to establish a workspace.
